Python functions
------------------

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task, Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.

Sample program: 
----------------

def greet():
	print('Hello World!')


Here def keyword is use to create function, "greet" is name of the function and "Hello World" is the function body
